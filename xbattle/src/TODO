* How to draw another type of board, e.g with hexagons?

* How to find the closest edge to the mouse click coord?

* How to handle when several sources are pumping into the same cell?

Perhaps use 'bucket' list ADT like:

  [{blue,25%}, {white,50%}, {red,25%}]

If we input a 'quanta' of 25% blue, then the resulting bucket would be:

  [{blue,50%}, {white,37.5%}, {red,12.5%}]

After, yet another 25% blue:

  [{blue,75%}, {white,25%}]

After, yet another 25% blue:

  [{blue,100%}]

After, yet another 25% blue:

  [{blue,100%}]  (nothing changes, the bucket is already full!)

* How should such a cell be represented on the board?

Perhaps a true color mix of the involved colors?
