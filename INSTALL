PREREQUISITES
=============

You may have to install the following to be able to compile everything:

  sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

If you want to connect over TCP then you may have make your X server
listen to a TCP port. If you have the lightdm WM then you could do
something like:

# /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/70-linuxmint.conf
-----------------------------------------------
[SeatDefaults]
user-session=cinnamon
xserver-allow-tcp=true          # new

[XDMCPServer]
enabled=true                    # new
-----------------------------------------------


If you run on a Mac you'll need to install XQuartz
(easy and it works right away)
